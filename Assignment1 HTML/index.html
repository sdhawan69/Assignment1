                <p>I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
                    We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
                    We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
                    But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then
                </p>
                <p> Kristen, come right back
                    I've been waiting for you
                    To slip back in bed
                    When you light the candle
                </p>
                <p> And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now
                    And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
                    Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
                    Think I like you best when you're just with me
                    And no one else
                </p>
                <p> Kristen, come right back
                    I've been waiting for you
                    To slip back in bed
                    When you light the candle
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I'm kissing you lying in my room
                    Holding you until you fall asleep
                    And it's just as good as I knew it would be
                    Stay with me, I don't want you to leave
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kristen, come right back
                    I've been waiting for you
                    To slip back in bed
                    When you light the candle</p>
